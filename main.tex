\title{3 Buddy Problem}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{The Problem}
Everyone needs a coding buddy. So we have a column associated with each user called “Buddy”. But now we need a group to have 3 people. How do we represent this group of three people?

\section{Some Solutions}
\begin{outline}[enumerate]
    \1 Add a column for the third person
        \2 What happens if we need to put a fourth person? fifth?
        \2 Do we really want so many empty cells associated with each of the other pairs?
            \3 Let’s try and avoid nulls
    \1 Comma separate the buddies columns
        \2 Not atomic
            \3 \href{https://www.1keydata.com/database-normalization/first-normal-form-1nf.php#:~:text=An\%20atomic\%20value\%20is\%20a,columns\%20that\%20are\%20closely\%20related.}{1keydata.com}
            \3 \href{https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/2342/what-is-atomic-relation-in-first-normal-form}{dba.stackexchange}
    \1 Create a new row for every pair within the new group
        \2 This is going to get really ugly really quickly. Imagine we need 1 group with 4 people. 8 rows?
        \2 $\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}$ pairs for any group of size n.
        \2 $O(n^2)$ space for this task should be viewed as unacceptable.
    \1 Create a new column called “Team\_Name”
        \2 Create a new table, “Teams'' with appropriate attributes and a primary key
        \2 There will be a one to many relationship between the CLASS\_ROASTER table and the TEAMS table via a foreign key relationship.
        \2 We should note that the team does not need to know who belongs to it
\end{outline}

\section{My Opinion}  I believe solution IV to be the correct solution. It will allow us to maintain a scalable, robust, minimal to no redundancies, and reusable design. It is now very easy and hopefully obvious how to add information about the teams going forward.
